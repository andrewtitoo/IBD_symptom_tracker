This is a custom-built app designed specifically to help track and manage my personal experience with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). The app logs my symptoms daily and helps me identify potential patterns and triggers by collecting detailed data on days when symptoms worsen.

Purpose
Living with IBD means managing unpredictable and often debilitating symptoms. To better understand how my lifestyle, diet, and other factors contribute to flare-ups, I built this app to simplify the process of symptom tracking. By logging everything in one place and analyzing patterns over time, I hope to gain deeper insights into what might be triggering my symptoms and how I can better manage them.

How It Works
Daily Symptom Logging: The app prompts me to input the severity of my IBD symptoms on a daily basis, such as abdominal pain, bloating, fatigue, and other common issues.

Trigger Detection: On days when my symptoms are marked as severe or worsening, the app asks additional questions to identify potential triggers. These can include recent diet changes, stress levels, exercise routines, or any other relevant factors that could contribute to the flare-up.

Data Logging: All the responses are logged in a spreadsheet for easy reference and analysis. Over time, I can refer back to these logs to spot patterns, correlations, or recurring triggers that may be making my IBD worse on specific days.

Personal Use: This app was specifically designed for my personal use, tailored to my daily experience with IBD. While it could be adapted for others, it's currently focused on the factors and symptoms that are most relevant to me.
